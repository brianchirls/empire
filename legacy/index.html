<div class="yellow_b">
<p>Between 1602 and 1795, nearly one million European colonists employed by The Dutch East India Company-known in Dutch as the Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie or VOC-sailed from The Netherlands to ports in Africa and Asia. Some returned to Europe with spices and textiles, while others perished abroad. Still others settled in unfamiliar territory and built plantations, forts and factories.</p>

<p>Exploration and exploitation of these regions was not new, as the English and Portuguese claimed their stake in the East long before the Dutch arrived. There was, however, one key difference to the Dutch endeavor: while other European colonials sailed under the protection of their royal houses, the Dutch sailed under a corporate logo. The VOC was just that: a privately held company operating independently from the Dutch government. It was the first company to issue public stock, and the first to control a private military. Through financial cunning and sheer force, the company pressured territories the world over into exclusive trading contracts.</p>

<p>The VOC's continuing legacy is proof that a corporation's influence can persist long after the corporation itself has disappeared. In Indonesia and Sri Lanka, in India and South Africa, the trading routes and social divisions carved out by 17th century merchants, bureaucrats and mercenaries continue to define society today.</p>

<p>Empire: Legacy was made possible by financial support from the Mondriaan Fund, and in-kind support & exhibition assistance from the following arts institutions: Theertha (Sri Lanka), HONF, Lifepatch & The Jogja National Museum (Indonesia), 1 Shanthi Rd & Khoj (India), Africa Centre & Stevenson Cape Town (South Africa). Local production assistance was provided by Pradeep Chadrisiri, Lexy Rambadeta and Hisham Samie.</p>
